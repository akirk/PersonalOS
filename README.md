# Personal OS is the operating system for your life installed in your digital home.

A modern note-taking and productivity system built on WordPress with the latest and greatest WordPress features.

### Few principles

- Methodologies borrowed from Building a Second Brain, and GTD
- Inspired by Roam Research, Logseq, Obsidian and Tana
- Opinionated. I will ship features because I want them
- Has to work with any WordPress supporting plugins
- Implement things the WordPress Wayâ„¢. WordPress has a ton of new APIs.

## Features

I consider this a humble start. I intend to grow this feature list until it becomes my main notetaking app.

### Notes

WordPress is very close to a great note-taking app out of the box. It just requires a few customizations:

- Fully private "note" Custom Post Type
- You can embed one note in the other via the Note Block
- Autosaving on by default so you never have to press save
- You can link notes using WordPress completer (`[[`)

### Transcriptions

Upload an mp3 and it will get transcribed and turned into a note.

### Readwise sync

Notes sync with Readwise.

- Preserve tags
- Every highlight turned into Readwise block with link to original
 
### Dashboard

Flexible dashboard implemented via Native WordPress Dashboard

### TODOs

Of course, you can manage your TODOs right in WP

## How to install

This is really WIP. Please follow the repo.
I will make a release once I have a stable version.
